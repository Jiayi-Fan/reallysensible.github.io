## Welcome

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh - Zhejiang University Institute. This is my public github repository. 

My major is biomedical informatics.

Now I'm studying at the international campus Zhejiang University, Haining, Jiaxing, Zhejiang.

I'm from Guangzhou, Guangdong.

My hobbies are reading, drawing, exercising.

I love to read books about psychology.

I'm fond in oil painting and I have been painting for years.
